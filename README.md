# Alarm-System-Powered-by-Solar-Energy 
Using Arduino UNO, DHT11(temperature and humidity sensor), MQ9(gas level sensor), Water Level Sensor, Flame detector sensor, IR LED and IR receiver to build an door opening detector. 
All the sensors are combined to form an alarm system and if alarm is triggered an audible sound will be produced by a buzzer and an alarm screen will be showed in mobile app created using MIT App Inventor.
